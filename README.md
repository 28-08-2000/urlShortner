# Django Projects

This repository is about learning Django and practice by creating projects.

## How to run

## Some Commands

`python manage.py migrate` - Migrate the database changes

## Troubleshooting

1. .gitignore for Django is same as python. If already commited then run `git rm --cached -r myFolder/` for removing them from tracking.
